FRS is an enterprise-grade recruitment engine designed to modernize academic hiring workflows through secure, state-persistent application pipelines. Built for IIT Indore, it empowers institutions to manage high-volume faculty applications with departmental precision, bridging the gap between complex data collection and rapid, role-based decision-making.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|------|-----------|
| Backend | Laravel 11 |
| Frontend | React (Inertia.js) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI |
| Database | MySQL |
| DevOps | Docker (Laravel Sail) |

## System Architecture

The FRS is engineered for reliability and developer productivity, utilizing a modern monolithic approach with a decoupled frontend experience.

### The Inertia Bridge
This system leverages **Inertia.js** to bridge the gap between Laravel and React. This allows for a Single Page Application (SPA) feel without the complexity of maintaining a separate REST or GraphQL API. 
* **Global State:** The `HandleInertiaRequests` middleware automatically shares the authenticated user's profile and session flash messages (success/error) with the React frontend.
* **Server-Side Routing:** Routing is handled entirely by Laravel, with Inertia managing the component rendering on the client side.

### Dockerized Environment (Laravel Sail)
The entire development stack is containerized using **Laravel Sail**, ensuring environment parity across all development machines.
* **PHP Runtime:** PHP 8.5.
* **Database:** MySQL 8.4.
* **Email Testing:** Mailpit integration for capturing outgoing recruitment and referee notifications.
* **Utilities:** phpMyAdmin is included for direct database management during development.

### 11-Step Application State
To support the intensive data collection required for academic hiring, the system implements a robust "Save as Draft" mechanism.
* **Database Persistence:** Instead of ephemeral session storage, the system uses a `json` column (`form_data`) in the `job_applications` table to persist the state of all 11 steps.
* **Draft Logic:** The `RecruitmentController` uses an `updateOrCreate` strategy, allowing applicants to save their progress at any step without triggering full-form validation.
* **Data Casting:** Laravel's Eloquent casting automatically transforms the JSON blob into a manageable PHP array for the backend and a JSON object for the React frontend.

## Visual Workflow

## Feature Deep-Dive

This section highlights the specialized functionalities implemented for each user role, focusing on the technical architecture of the recruitment lifecycle.

### Admin: Institutional Oversight

- **Advertisement Management**  
  Dynamic creation of job postings with support for consolidated PDF uploads and multi-department targeting.

- **Dynamic Discipline Configuration**  
  A full CRUD interface for managing the institution's department list, ensuring the recruitment pool stays aligned with academic restructuring.

- **HOD Assignment Matrix**  
  Granular control over faculty roles, allowing admins to promote users to HOD status and bind them to specific departmental silos.

- **Global Dossier Access**  
  Cross-departmental search and filtering of all submitted applications with bulk export capabilities for institutional reporting.

### Applicant: The 11-Step Wizard

- **State Persistence Layer**  
  Utilizes a `json` column (`form_data`) to store dense academic data (publications, patents, research plans), enabling a seamless "resume-anytime" draft experience.

- **Role-Specific Dashboard**  
  Real-time tracking of application statuses (*Submitted, Shortlisted, Rejected*) and a centralized hub for downloading generated dossiers.

- **Referee Automation**  
  Integrated dispatch of `RefereeNotification` emails to all listed referees via Mailpit-verified SMTP triggers upon finalization.

- **Export Engine**  
  On-the-fly generation of professionally formatted PDFs using `dompdf` and detailed Excel dossiers for personal record-keeping.

### HOD: Departmental Review 

- **Security Scoping**  
  Architectural implementation of departmental silos; HODs are locked into their assigned discipline via backend query scoping, preventing unauthorized access to other departments.

- **Dossier Deep-Dive**  
  A specialized review interface built with collapsible Shadcn/UI components to navigate complex 11-step applicant data efficiently.

- **Status Transition Workflow**  
  Single-click decision pipeline allowing HODs to move applicants from *"Awaiting Review"* to *"Shortlisted"* or *"Rejected"* states.

- **Committee Exports**  
  Ability to generate department-specific CSV summaries for offline review during faculty selection committee meetings.

## Installation 

Follow these steps to get the Faculty Recruitment System running locally using **Laravel Sail**.


### Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** installed and running  
- **Node.js & npm** installed on your host machine (for initial frontend builds)

---

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository & Environment Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/varunbalaji167/FRS_Laravel.git
cd frs_laravel
cp .env.example .env
```

---

#### 2. Install Dependencies  
Since the PHP environment is containerized, use a temporary container to install composer dependencies:

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v "$(pwd):/var/www/html" \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php84-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

---

#### 3. Start the Environment  
Launch the Docker containers in the background:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

The system uses **PHP 8.5** and **MySQL 8.4** as defined in `compose.yaml`.

---

#### 4. Initialize Database & Key
```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed
```

---

#### 5. Frontend Development  
Install React dependencies and start the Vite dev server:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm install
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
```

---

### Access Ports
- **Web Application:** http://localhost 
- **Mailpit (Email Testing):** http://localhost:8025  
- **phpMyAdmin:** http://localhost:8080

## Directory Structure

The frontend is organized to maintain a clear separation between reusable UI components, global layouts, and specific page logic. Below is the structure of the `resources/js` directory:

## API Endpoints & Role-Based Logic Flow

This section provides a technical map of the system's communication layer, categorized by user role. Each endpoint follows the **Inertia.js protocol**, where the backend provides a JSON state that the React frontend renders into a seamless SPA experience.

---

### 6. Background Logic & Notifications

These processes are **decoupled from the UI** and triggered by lifecycle events.

#### Mail Services

| Service | File | Flow |
|--------|------|------|
| ApplicationSubmitted | `app/Mail/ApplicationSubmitted.php` | Triggered on final submission → Sends confirmation + PDF |
| RefereeNotification | `app/Mail/RefereeNotification.php` | Triggered on submission → Requests referee recommendations |
